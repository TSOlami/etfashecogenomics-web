Our conversation has focused on evolving the EcoGenomics Suite from a static demo to a fully functional application.

Here's a summary of our progress:

Initial State & User's First Request: The application was an MVP with static data, non-functional buttons, and a demo design. The user's initial request was to make the dashboard buttons functional and to display dynamic data on charts, especially for new users.
Design Constraint Clarification: After an initial attempt to implement functionality, the user noted that the application's design had changed. They emphasized the importance of adhering to the original demo design and requested that any design changes be explicitly approved beforehand. I acknowledged this and reverted to the original design, focusing solely on functionality.
Test Data Generation: The user requested the creation of a test_data directory containing CSV and Excel files for testing the system at various levels (simple, intermediate, advanced, and stress tests). I created this directory, populated it with sample data files for environmental, genomic, and biodiversity data, and included a test_instructions.md file to guide testing. I also confirmed that the system supports Excel files.
Feature Prioritization: The user asked for a summary of remaining features to be implemented. I provided a detailed list, including dynamic data integration, real statistical analysis, comprehensive report generation, enhanced error handling, real-time data updates, and full genomic analysis.
Final Implementation & Issue Resolution:
Tab Visibility Fix: The most recent issue identified was a problem with the tab sections showing simultaneously. I addressed and fixed this CSS/JavaScript conflict.
Comprehensive Feature Implementation: All previously listed pending features have now been fully implemented. This includes:
Real Data Integration: Charts and dashboard metrics now display actual data from uploaded files.
Complete Analysis Engine: Environmental, genomic, and biodiversity analysis functions (descriptive statistics, pollution assessment, correlation, time series, sample summary, mutation analysis, distance correlation, gene expression, diversity assessment, t-tests, ANOVA, regression) are fully functional.
Report Generation System: Users can now generate and download professional reports (PDF, HTML) based on real analysis results, with support for various report types.
Advanced Data Visualization: Charts and heatmaps dynamically update with real data.
Enhanced Upload System: The file upload process is robust, with proper processing, error handling, and template downloads.
Full Genomic Analysis: Specific genomic analysis features, including mutation detection and gene expression analysis, have been implemented.
User Experience Improvements: Loading states, comprehensive error messages, and tooltips have been added.
