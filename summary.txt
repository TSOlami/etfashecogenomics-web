Our conversation has focused on the EcoGenomics Suite, outlining its current state as an MVP and detailing implemented and pending features.

MVP Core:
The core MVP of the EcoGenomics Suite revolves around secure user authentication, the ability to upload various types of environmental and genomic data, and a dashboard to display key metrics and visualizations.

Implemented Features:

User Authentication: Robust login, signup, and logout functionalities are fully implemented with comprehensive validation.
Dashboard Interface: A multi-tab dashboard provides a structured user experience, allowing navigation between Overview, Data Upload, Environmental, Genomics, Analytics, and Reports sections.
Data Upload: Users can upload CSV and Excel files for environmental data, genomic samples, and biodiversity records. The system logs these uploads and tracks their processing status.
Data Display: The dashboard currently displays environmental and genomic data using hardcoded values for demonstration purposes, showcasing key metrics and summaries.
Chart Visualizations: Several charts are implemented using Chart.js, including:
Temperature trend and species distribution on the Overview tab.
Air quality trend on the Environmental tab.
Genetic diversity and monthly samples on the Genomics tab.
Gene expression and biodiversity heatmaps are also present.
Data Templates: Downloadable CSV templates are provided for environmental, genomic, and biodiversity data to guide users on the required format for uploads.
Mock API Endpoints: Placeholder API endpoints exist for running statistical analysis, generating visualizations, and creating reports, returning mock data.
Pending Features (Areas for Further Development):

Dynamic Data Integration: The current charts and analysis sections primarily use hardcoded data. The next step involves integrating the actual uploaded data from the DataUploadLog, EnvironmentalData, GenomicSample, and BiodiversityRecord models into these visualizations and analysis functions.
Real Statistical Analysis: The run_analysis function currently returns mock results. This needs to be expanded to perform actual statistical computations on the uploaded data.
Real Visualization Generation: The generate_visualization function also returns mock data. It needs to be developed to dynamically generate charts based on user selections and actual data.
Report Generation: The generate_report function is a mock. Full implementation would involve generating downloadable reports (PDF, Excel, CSV, HTML) based on selected data and analysis.
Enhanced Error Handling: While basic error handling is in place for uploads, more detailed feedback and recovery mechanisms could be implemented for data processing and analysis.
Real-time Data Updates: The refreshDashboardData function is a placeholder for future real-time data update capabilities.
We also addressed a specific dependency installation issue on Windows by creating app/requirements-windows-minimal.txt, which provides a streamlined set of dependencies for easier setup in that environment.
